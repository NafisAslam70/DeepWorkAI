## 🧠 The DLEF Framework

**DeepLens Engine for Focus (DLEF)** — A novel 4-layer attention detection architecture:
```
Webcam Frame → [L1: Classification] → [L2: Validation] → [L3: Temporal] → [L4: Response]
```

| Layer | Component | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **L1** | YOLOv11n-cls | Primary 6-class classification (94.76% accuracy) |
| **L2** | MediaPipe + YOLOv8n | Gaze estimation, EAR analysis, phone validation |
| **L3** | 20/30 Rule | Temporal heuristic — confirms sustained distraction |
| **L4** | Nudge System | Context-aware intervention messages |

### Attention States

| State | Description | Priority |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Focused | Eyes on task, engaged posture | ✅ Productive |
| Phone | Using mobile device | 🔴 Critical |
| Absent | Not present in frame | 🔴 Critical |
| Drowsy | Signs of fatigue (EAR < 0.25) | 🟡 Secondary |
| LookingAway | Gaze diverted > 45° | 🟡 Secondary |
| BadPosture | Slouched, disengaged | 🟡 Secondary |

## 📊 Model Performance

| Class | Precision | Recall | Accuracy |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Focused | 0.854 | 1.000 | 100.00% |
| Phone | 1.000 | 1.000 | 100.00% |
| Absent | 1.000 | 1.000 | 100.00% |
| Drowsy | 0.917 | 0.943 | 94.29% |
| LookingAway | 0.970 | 0.914 | 91.43% |
| BadPosture | 0.967 | 0.829 | 82.86% |
| **Overall** | **0.951** | **0.948** | **94.76%** |

> 📝 **Note**: Evaluated on 210 held-out validation images (35 per class, non-augmented).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- Webcam

### 1️⃣ Frontend Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### 2️⃣ Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

## 🔬 Training Your Own Model
```bash
cd model

# Train on your dataset
python train.py

# Evaluate on validation set
python test.py
```

See [`model/README.md`](model/README.md) for detailed instructions.

---

## 📊 Dataset

A sample of the training dataset is provided for reproducibility:
```
dataset_sample/
├── train/    (48 images - 8 per class)
└── val/      (30 images - 5 per class)
```

See [`dataset_sample/README.md`](dataset_sample/README.md) for details.

**Full Dataset**: 1,080 base images → ~3,000 after augmentation

---

## 🔒 Privacy

DeepWork AI is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- ✅ **On-device processing** — No video frames sent to external servers
- ✅ **No video storage** — Only derived metrics (focus %, distraction counts) are saved
- ✅ **User control** — Camera access revocable anytime
- ✅ **Transparency** — Visual indicator shows when monitoring is active
